              <p>Joluud is a mobile first web application that allows facility managers aggregate and track requests from your hostels, apartments, hotels, offices etc.</p>
                
                <p>As a facility manager, managing a facility requires a lot of attention to your occupants needs. It isn't easy to keep track of a lot of requests at the same time. Your clients voicing out their complaints at the same time can lead to negligence or oversight. To better manage this, Joluud is an application that helps solve your issue. Create and manage maintenance requests from requesters.
                    View historical data on past work orders.
                    Available cross-platform on mobile and desktop.</p>
                    <p>We wanted an easier UX and cleaner interface for the application</p>
                <p>On joining the team, the first MVP was already out and had a lot of responsiveness issues. This was my initial task in the team.After a getting feedbacks from our existing clients via surveys and managing their activity on FullStory,
                     we learnt different ways in which our application can be better.We learnt that we weren't good enough.
                      That we weren't solving the entire problem well enough. We could do better with the application.

                <h6>Issues Raised</h6>
                <ul>
                        <li> The landing page wasn't descriptive enough in terms of content as to what our offerings were.</li>
                        <li>It wasn't clear what our Unique Selling Point was as compared to other facility management softwares in the market.</li>
                        <li>Onboarding for new customers wasn't so seamless.</li>
                        <li>It was not easy to keep track of messages from the requesters.</li>
                        <li>Navigation within the dashboard lacked structure and consistency.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h6>Goals</h6>
                <ul>
                        <li> Redesign the landing page for increase in conversion and usage of the application</li>

            <h6>Redesign Process</h6>
            <p>As a result of feedbacks gotten from our existing clients and testers, the existing Application had issues flaws in the step a user can take in the usage of the app. It was important to design the app in such a way that aids simplicity of usage. I came up with an easier app flow for the web application</p>

            <div class="lesson__item">
                <h6>Prioritize Experience Over Features</h6>
                <p>A startup means you have to make hard calls.
                     You have to decide what to cut out to ship on time.
                    I learnt this balance— while still sticking to quality. 
                    It worked well because people responded to our difference in quality.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="lesson__item">
                    <h6>Don't be too precious over an idea</h6>
                    <p>The product has gone through  gone through so many versions; some of them public. 
                        It’s important to not hesitate to kill your babies. 
                        I get to debate with the product engineer for the best idea. 
                        When we see a good idea, we take it; it's best for the product; it doesn't matter who it came from.
                    </p>
            </div>
            <div class="lesson__item">
                <h6>TO APPRECIATE THE GAPS</h6>
                <p>I asked people who were experts in their field to give me advice. They helped me fill in the gaps that I had in my skillset and also gave constructive feedbacks.
                     They also helped make sure I understood why I was making some design decisions before implementing without bias.
                    It’s easy to be in denial of the gaps or to “wing it”, but this was a quicker workaround.
